Yo so the Warriors, Cavaliers, and Mavericks are all expected to make a run at LeBron James when his contract is up after the 2025 26 season, and man that’s pretty wild to think about James will be 41 next summer but even with that age he’s still putting up crazy numbers like 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists last year, so his skills are still elite and you gotta wonder how much longer he’ll keep going but his name alone makes him the top free agent target for sure, I mean I give him a solid A grade just based on his legacy and talent, and those three teams are definitely eager to get him back home in Cleveland, or maybe make a splash in Dallas or even join the Warriors and that’s gonna be interesting to see how it plays out next summer who do you think lands him
