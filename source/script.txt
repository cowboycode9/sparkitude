Yo, did you see the headline, guys, the Warriors, Cavs, and Mavericks all are gonna chase LeBron next summer, can you believe it, after his contract runs out, this is wild, like, he's still out there, at 41, and he's still putting up numbers, like, 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 8.2 assists last season, seriously, how many guys would even be doing that at that age, but the thing is, nobody's sure if he’s gonna keep playing at that level, right, but still, his name alone, as one of the greatest ever, makes him the biggest free agent target, easily, and those three teams, Cleveland, Dallas, Golden State, they've all got their eyes on him, it’s like a high-stakes chase, and honestly, who wouldn’t want LeBron on their team, right, this could totally shape the league, what do you guys think, are you surprised at all, or is this just what we kinda expected?
